Its inspiration is drawn from Unity software and Unity ML Agents , adapted in Python. The goal is to be able to simulate environments in logistics, retails, epidemiology, providing pre-coded spatial environments and communication between agents. Optimization can be included using heuristics as well as Reinforcement Learning. Note The name is of course inspired by the TV series Westworld, which is actually a gigantic multi-agent simulation system.","title":"Welcome to Westworld documentation"},{"location":"#welcome-to-westworld-documentation","text":"Westworld is a multi-agent simulation library, its goal to simulate and optimize systems and environments with multiple agents interacting.
