Its inspiration is drawn from Unity software and Unity ML Agents , adapted in Python. The goal is to be able to simulate environments in logistics, retails, epidemiology, providing pre-coded spatial environments and communication between agents. Optimization can be included using heuristics as well as Reinforcement Learning.
